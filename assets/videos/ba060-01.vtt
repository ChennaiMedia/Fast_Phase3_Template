00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.720
Hi there, imagine you would like to establish a new

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.540
venture, as you have identified a clear opportunity,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.930
and written a brilliant business plan. You will likely

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.450
need quite some money from shareholders, before you can

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.390
actually get started, as will be explained in this

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.840
video.

7
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.060
The two main providers of financing are shareholders, and debt holders,

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.630
typically banks. But as a start-up, getting bank debt

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.330
will prove challenging, as a banks hardly take risks.

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.760
They want to be relatively sure that you can repay

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.550
loans for which you need a stable opening cashflow,

12
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.270
or enough security, or collateral. It is similar to

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.430
private individuals pledging their house to get a

14
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.690
mortgage loan, and you often need to show a

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.220
slip. So companies will first need to raise money

16
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.360
from shareholders. A shareholder is someone who invests money

17
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.730
in return for a piece of ownership, usually shareholders

18
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.330
have voting rights proportionate to their shareholdings.

19
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.370
The first shareholder will likely be yourself, investing

20
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.080
your savings as the founder, yet this will generally

21
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.130
not be sufficient. Next is the famous three F's,

22
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.860
family, friends, and fools. While you would commonly

23
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.760
succeed in convincing people close to you, as they are

24
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.400
confident you will succeed, this will be tougher

25
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.300
with others, as it is a high risk investment. Or

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.190
you could send out a business plan to professional

27
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.190
investment firms, called venture capitalists, or private

28
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.070
equity providers who invest money in promising

29
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.530
companies, with an aim to sell their stakes later at

30
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.770
large gain. They provide smart money as they will

31
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.560
actively try to boost the venture's performance by

32
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.090
offering hands-on advice and support. A well known

33
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.970
name is Seqouia Capital who invested in firms like Apple

34
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.780
and Google. Or you may look for business angels, which

35
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.870
are wealthy private individuals, or for a big

36
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.350
company e.g. Big Pharma often take stakes in bio-tech

37
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.010
start-ups. And employees may become shareholders too,

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.730
both in large established firms and in start-ups, where shares may

39
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.040
entail a large chunk of their compensation.

40
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.510
Governments too may become shareholders, in order to avoid

41
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.230
bankruptcy of large firms, they may decide to bail them

42
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.640
out and basically nationalise firms. Alternatively

43
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.970
governments may offer all kinds of financing

44
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.880
schemes such as subsidies, or loan guarantees to

45
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.630
support innovative ventures. More mature firms

46
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.210
might even consider to go public, and list on the stock

47
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.270
market. This allows for raising a huge amount of

48
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.900
money, like with a Facebook IPO. Yet it requires a

49
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.770
burdensome expensive process. Similarly,

50
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.440
crowdfunding offers access to public money, by

51
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.920
pitching business proposals, investors either get shares,

52
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.100
provide a loan, do a gift or get paid in kind .

53
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.980
As you can tell shareholders are critical in every

54
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.300
business, without them you can't get started, and

55
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.860
substantial investment from shareholders also acts

56
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.170
as a signal towards other potential financiers.

57
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.860
Remember though,  that they seek a proper return

58
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.040
on their equity investments, so you better make sure

59
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.200
that the business is ultimately successful.
