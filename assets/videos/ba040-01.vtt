00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.660
A learning journey on understanding financial figures

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.350
reported by companies, should always start with a thorough

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.560
understanding of the balance sheet. This lecture

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.110
will illustrate the big building blocks of such a

5
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.710
document.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.310
The balance sheet is one of the key documents in a

7
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.970
company's annual report, and basically consists of

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.510
two sides. The left hand side provides an overview

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.510
of the company's property and belongings, generally

10
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.350
referred to as assets. The right hand side

11
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.200
presents all the resources that have been used to

12
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.690
finance these assets. As a consequence the total

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.500
amounts at both sides, should always be equal. The

14
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.470
balance sheet needs to be made at least once a year,

15
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.980
typically at the end of the calendar year. Although

16
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.110
companies are free to opt for an alternative

17
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.640
closing date of the accounts.

18
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.990
Let's now zoom in on the left hand side of the balance

19
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.950
sheet. The first distinction is made based upon

20
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.710
how long the assets are expected to be deployed at

21
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.030
the company. Fixed assets or, non-current assets

22
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.030
typically stay longer than one year in the

23
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.720
organisation. While current assets are expected to

24
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.190
remain less than a year.

25
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.350
We further distinguish between two types of fixed

26
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.580
assets. Tangible assets are all fixed assets, with

27
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.300
a physical appearance, such as land, buildings,

28
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.070
machines, equipment, cars, and trucks. These are

29
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.150
often referred to as property, plans and equipment

30
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.190
or P P E.

31
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.970
Intangible assets do not have a physical shape, but

32
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.230
can be of great importance to the company.

33
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.910
Examples include intellectual property, patents

34
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.050
and licences.

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.800
Three types of current assets can be identified.

36
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.540
First, inventory, captures raw materials or

37
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.520
finished products that are not yet sold.

38
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.800
Second, accounts receivable, reflects the amount of

39
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.550
money that still needs to be paid, by clients for

40
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.670
goods or services that have already been delivered.

41
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.700
Finally, cash and short term money investments are the

42
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.650
most liquid assets in a company.

43
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.720
At the right hand side we make a primary

44
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.610
distinction between equity and liabilities. Equity

45
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.700
reflects financing provided by shareholders. It

46
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.840
consists of capital that is brought in directly by

47
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.290
shareholders, as well as the proportion of profits

48
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.750
that is not yet paid out as dividends,

49
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.260
labelled as retained earnings or reserves.

50
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.390
Liabilities or debt represent borrowed amounts,

51
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.200
and hence need to be repaid at one moment in time.

52
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.730
Again a distinction is made between short term, so

53
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.000
current, and long term, so non-current liabilities.

54
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.190
In addition we distinguish between financial and

55
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.360
operating liabilities, financial debt involves

56
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.450
interest bearing debt, stemming from banks or

57
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.800
bondholders. Bondholders are investors that lend

58
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.460
money directly to companies via the capital markets.

59
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.230
Operating liabilities on the other hand, relate to

60
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.400
the company's operations such as payments due to

61
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.800
suppliers, employees or the government.

62
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.850
I hope you all agree that the balance sheet is a

63
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.230
relatively easy document to read, that already gives

64
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.540
us some very relevant insights in, at the one hand,

65
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.770
what type of assets are companies investing in, and,

66
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.450
at the other hand, how it succeeded in financing

67
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.140
these assets.
