Hi, while both banks and shareholders provide money

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.220
to business it's important to be aware of some

3
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.900
key distinctions, depending on the origin of the

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.920
funds, as will be discussed in this lecture.

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.320
First there is a gigantic difference in terms of

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.500
compensation. Bank debt is not for free as interest

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.620
payments are legally due, failing to do so will

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.100
lead to additional expenses, financial distress,

9
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.620
default, and worst case, bankruptcy. No interest

10
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.790
is due to shareholders although they might get

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.400
dividends. There is no hard commitment to pay out

12
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.820
dividends, so these may be scrapped, if profits

13
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.670
were disappointing. No dividends however, don't

14
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.220
apply on shareholders that don't get any return on investment

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.380
as they're actually entitled to all earnings

16
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.290
generated. Profits, may either be paid out as a

17
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.740
dividend or retained and reinvested causing a rise

18
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.900
in company and share value. Yet the downside is

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.220
that shareholders will need to bear losses. Second, the

20
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.480
firm is to reimburse the bank debt by making

21
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.520
repayments of the principal amount, that maturity

22
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.390
could be anything from a few days to some decades,

23
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.630
but all debt must be paid off. Alternatively,

24
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.430
shareholder capital is normally a permanent investment that will

25
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.970
remain available to the company. If stockholders

26
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.290
want to exit their holdings, they will need to look

27
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.050
for others who want to acquire their shares. In the case of

28
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.840
bankruptcy, all assets are liquidated and the

29
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.290
proceeds are first used to reimburse debt holders.

30
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.150
Priority is actually given to special items like

31
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.870
salaries, taxes, and social security due. Typically

32
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.510
shareholders will not be able to recover much.

33
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.690
Interestingly in most countries debt financing gets

34
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.750
a more favourable treatment by tax authorities as

35
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.000
interest charges, in contrast to dividends

36
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.750
represent a tax deductible cost. Finally, who is

37
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.210
in control and essentially has a final say upon

38
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.420
any major corporate decision. Even in cases where

39
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.850
banks put in much more funds than shareholders, it is the

40
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.860
latter that decide as they are the ultimate

41
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.920
owners and have voting rights unlike banks. You

42
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.210
might have guessed it would be the board of

43
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.740
directors or the CEO, sure but in the end these

44
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.560
individuals are nominated by shareholders. Yet

45
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.680
banks will have indirect influence as they can

46
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.250
force firms into bankruptcy, in the case of default.

47
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.300
Moreover, loan contracts will predictably include

48
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.580
conditions and covenants that affect a board of

49
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.330
shareholders, such as limits on dividend payouts,

50
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.580
additional debt that can be raised, bank approval for

51
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.530
capex and any major decisions.

52
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.400
Keep in mind that both sources of financing have

53
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.940
benefits and drawbacks. There is no real optimal

54
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.120
balance, and the depth of such a choice will depend

55
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.970
on the company's specific situation, the financial

56
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.480
market conditions, and shareholders risk appetite. However,

57
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.500
companies should not have too much debt, as

58
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.730
we will highlight when discussing solvency.
