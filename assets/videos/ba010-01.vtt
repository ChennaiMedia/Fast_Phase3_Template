00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.100
Are you ready to start your company? You have

2
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.470
developed a business plan for a company, Aquasail.

3
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.480
It will build high end sailboats. You are a longtime

4
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.190
sailor yourself, so you have a deep understanding

5
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.170
of the requirements of sailboat owners. Your

6
00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.770
business plan suggests there is a real demand for

7
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.770
the type of sailboats you aim to build. You will mainly

8
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.530
assemble the boats using parts that are readily

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.950
available from third parties. So after having

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.500
talked to the bank, and looked at your own savings,

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.070
you decided to take the plunge, and just do it. You

12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.150
now have to incorporate Aquasail officially, by

13
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.250
issuing shares. Thereafter you'll raise some money

14
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.390
from the bank. With that starting money Aqua

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.640
Sail will buy a nice building, and the land which

16
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.580
you already spotted. You have already contacted

17
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.370
suppliers, who are able to sell you the necessary

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.270
assembly lines immediately. How will all these

19
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.720
transactions affect Aquasail's cash situation, and its

20
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.470
balance sheet?
