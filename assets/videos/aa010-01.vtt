00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.960
Welcome to the finance and accounting simulation

2
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.320
tool - or FAST. Each manager should be able to

3
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.750
understand how managerial decisions affect the

4
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.320
financial health of a firm or an organisation, or

5
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.260
understand how the firm is doing financially. This

6
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.690
is what you will learn in this simulation. It

7
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.270
requires no prior knowledge at all of either

8
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.810
accounting or finance. We will guide you step by step

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.460
through important financial statements that are

10
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.850
produced by accountants: the balance sheet, profit and loss or

11
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.030
income statement and cashflow statement. We will

12
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.100
provide you as well with the basic tools to

13
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.470
analyse the financial statements to understand the

14
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.440
firm's current financial risk and past value

15
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.590
creation. The goal of this course is not to turn

16
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.310
you into financial or accounting experts. Rather, it

17
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.290
gives you the tools to understand the language

18
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.840
of accountants, controllers, financial managers.

19
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.360
Further, all managerial decisions, in whatever

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.360
department, affect an organisation's financial

21
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.150
health. After having gone through the simulation,

22
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.370
you should be able to understand how your

23
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.070
decisions affect your organisation's financial

24
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.640
risk and value creation. Within the simulation,

25
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.670
you will start your own company, Aquasail.

26
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.980
It's aimed at manufacturing top quality sailboats.

27
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.960
You will run it for two years, and translate all your

28
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.800
decisions into accounting statements.

29
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.550
Enjoy the learning!
