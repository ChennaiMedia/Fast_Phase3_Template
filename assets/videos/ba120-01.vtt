00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.950
In this module we have introduced the main sources

2
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.010
of funding of any company. Shareholders equity,

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.400
bank debt, which appear on the right hand side of a

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.980
balance sheet. The left hand side of the balance

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.650
sheet shows how these funds have been reduced.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.370
Aquasail has invested in long term assets which

7
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.180
are called fixed assets. And these include the

8
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.330
land, the building, the equipment. Aquasail further has 

9
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.760
some cash left in its bank account. This is a short

10
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.340
term or a current asset. A balance sheet hence is a

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.810
picture of all sources and uses of a funding of a

12
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.230
company. As you have experienced we can take this

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.320
picture at any point in time. But in the remainder

14
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.960
of the simulation we will only make balance sheets

15
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.870
at the end of the year. It would be very boring and

16
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.510
tedious to do these more frequently. But it is

17
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.570
possible. And actually that's one of the recurring

18
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.110
tasks of accountants. Next to the balance sheet we

19
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.140
have developed Aquasail's cashflow statement. In

20
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.230
contrast to the balance sheet, which is a picture,

21
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.720
a cash flow statement is a movie of all cash

22
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.000
receipts and payments over a certain period of

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.840
time. Here, we only looked at the first day in the

24
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.230
life of Aquasail. The remainder of the simulation

25
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.860
we will focus on what happens during the quarter.
